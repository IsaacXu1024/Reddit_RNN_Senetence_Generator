# Reddit_RNN_Senetence_Generator


I created this project out of my desire to learn more about neural nets and their potential for natural language processing. Using keras with theano backend, I was able to train a network to generate some sentences which resemble human created text to a limited degree. Examples are given in the "training_logs" directory.

This project was inspired in part by the rnn introduction post over at http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/.
