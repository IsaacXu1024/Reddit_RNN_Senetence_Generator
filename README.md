# Reddit_RNN_Senetence_Generator


This bot is trained on 196 737 comments scraped from the science subreddit through the use of my Reddit_Spider project. In total I trained the provided net 15 epochs over a period of about 2 days. Additional details may be found in the training log.

I created this project out of my desire to learn more about neural nets and their potential for natural language processing. Using keras with theano backend, I was able to train a network to generate some sentences which resemble human created text to a limited degree. Examples are given in the "training_logs" directory.

This project was inspired in part by the rnn introduction post over at http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/.
